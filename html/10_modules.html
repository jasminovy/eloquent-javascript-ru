<blockquote>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_PJiK2g1JXC" href="#p_PJiK2g1JXC"></a>A beginning programmer writes his programs like an ant builds her
hill, one piece at a time, without thought for the bigger structure.
His programs will be like loose sand. They may stand for a while, but
growing too big they fall apart.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_OfZWeuo+oF" href="#p_OfZWeuo+oF"></a>Realizing this problem, the programmer will start to spend a lot of
time thinking about structure. His programs will be rigidly
structured, like rock sculptures. They are solid, but when they must
change, violence must be done to them.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_fFMEGH1dk3" href="#p_fFMEGH1dk3"></a>The master programmer knows when to apply structure and when to leave
things in their simple form. His programs are like clay, solid yet
malleable.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_1aMUBkVbPd" href="#p_1aMUBkVbPd"></a>Every program has a shape. On a small scale, this shape is determined
by the division into functions, and the blocks inside those functions.
Programmers have a lot of freedom in the shape they give their
programs. Shape follows more from the good or bad taste of the
programmer than from the program&#8217;s intended functionality.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_NOETmtvWWx" href="#p_NOETmtvWWx"></a>When looking at a larger program in its entirety, individual functions
start to blend into the background, and it would be good to have a
larger unit of organization.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_07zdYJYQ1M" href="#p_07zdYJYQ1M"></a><em>Modules</em> divide programs into clusters of code that, by <em>some</em>
criterion, belong together. This chapter explores some of the
benefits that such clustering provides, and shows techniques for
building modules in JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="_organization">Organization</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_gUjLRL1uwP" href="#p_gUjLRL1uwP"></a>There are number of reasons why authors divide their books into
chapters and sections. Such a division makes it easier for a reader to
see how the book is built up, and to find specific parts that they are
interested in. They also help the <em>author</em>, by providing a clear focus
for every section.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_QxCtWUR2zJ" href="#p_QxCtWUR2zJ"></a>The benefits of organizing a program into several files or modules are
analogous. Structure helps people who aren&#8217;t yet familiar with the
code find what they are looking for, and makes it easier for the
programmer to keep things that are closely related close together.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_63qmc2JeEF" href="#p_63qmc2JeEF"></a>Some programs are even organized along the model of a traditional
text, with a well-defined order in which the reader is encouraged to
go through the program, and lots of prose (comments) providing a
coherent description of the code. This make reading the program a lot
less intimidating—reading unknown code is usually intimidating—but has
the downside of being more work to set up, and making it more
difficult to change the program, because prose tends to be more
tightly interconnected than code. This style is called <em>literate
programming</em>. The “project” chapters of this book can be considered to
be literate programs.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_Ou/d4KbIy/" href="#p_Ou/d4KbIy/"></a>As a general rule, structuring things costs energy, and in the early
stages of a project, when you are not quite sure yet what goes where
or what kind of modules the program needs at all, I endorse a
minimalist, structure-less attitude. Just put everything wherever it
is convenient to put it until the code stabilizes. That way, you won&#8217;t
be over-thinking the organization with insufficient information, won&#8217;t
be wasting time moving pieces of the program back and forth, and won&#8217;t
accidentally lock yourself into a structure that does not actually fit
your program.</p>
<h2 id="_namespaces">Namespaces</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_8S/+Hon3uA" href="#p_8S/+Hon3uA"></a>Most modern programming languages have a scope level between <em>global</em>
(everyone can see it) and <em>local</em> (only this function can see it).
JavaScript does not. Thus, by default, everything that needs to be
visible outside of the small scope of the current function is visible
<em>everywhere</em>.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_QMB7RIsBay" href="#p_QMB7RIsBay"></a>Namespace pollution, the problem of a lot of unrelated code having to
share a single set of global variable names, was mentioned in chapter
4, where the <code>Math</code> object was given as an example of an object that
acts like a module by grouping math-related functionality.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_bBKNVkrywA" href="#p_bBKNVkrywA"></a>Though JavaScript provides no actual module construct yet, objects can
be used to create publicly accessible sub-namespaces, and functions
can be used to create an isolated, private namespace inside of a
module. Later on in this chapter, I will discuss techniques that allow
us to build reasonably convenient, namespace-isolating modules on top
of the primitive concepts that JavaScript gives us.</p>
<h2 id="_reuse">Reuse</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_0MwF7DbAP0" href="#p_0MwF7DbAP0"></a>In a “flat” project, it is not apparent which parts of the code are
needed to use a particular function. If, in my program for spying on
my enemies, I wrote a function for reading configuration files, and
now I want to use that function again in another project, I must go
and copy out the part of the old program that look like they are
relevant to the functionality that I need, and paste them into my new
program. Then, if I find a mistake in that code, I will fix it in the
program that I was working with at the time, and forget to also fix it
in the other program.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_n5Itkf6SsY" href="#p_n5Itkf6SsY"></a>Once you have lots of such shared, duplicated pieces of code, you will
find yourself wasting a lot of time and energy on moving them around
and keeping them up to date.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_zRF+dQHy2t" href="#p_zRF+dQHy2t"></a>When pieces of functionality that stand on their own are put into
separate files and modules, they can be easily kept track of, updated
when a new version is created, or even shared, by having the various
pieces of code that want to use them load the same actual file.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_3seo7geVwh" href="#p_3seo7geVwh"></a>This idea gets even more powerful when the relations between
modules—which other modules each module depends on—are explicitly
stated. You can then automate the process of installing and upgrading
external modules.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_o3pQIcy1rn" href="#p_o3pQIcy1rn"></a>And, taking this even further, imagine an online service that tracks
and distributes hundreds of thousands of such modules, allowing you to
search for the functionality you need, and, once you find it, set up
your project to automatically download it.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_8hHGZUvmtE" href="#p_8hHGZUvmtE"></a>This service exists. It is called <em>NPM</em> (<a href="http://npmjs.org"><em>npmjs.org</em></a>).
NPM consists of an online database of modules, and a tool for
downloading and upgrading the modules your program depends on. It grew
out of node.js, the browser-less JavaScript environment we will discuss in
Chapter FIXME, but can also be useful when programming for the browser.</p>
<h2 id="_decoupling">Decoupling</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_BIr3LxVodJ" href="#p_BIr3LxVodJ"></a>Another important role of modules is isolating pieces of code from
each other, in the same way that the object interfaces from Chapter 6
do. A well-designed module will provide an interface for external code
to use, and as the module is further worked on (bugs are fixed,
functionality is added) the existing interface stays stable, so that
other modules can use a new, improved version without any changes to
themselves.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_B3JCtLjLbo" href="#p_B3JCtLjLbo"></a>Note that a stable interface does not mean no new elements are added.
It just means that the existing elements aren&#8217;t removed and their
meaning is not changed.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_Gpelzze5wE" href="#p_Gpelzze5wE"></a>Building a module interface that allows the module to grow without
breaking the old interface means finding a good trade-off between
exposing as little internal concepts as possible to the outside world,
and yet making the “language” that the interface exposes powerful and
flexible enough to be applicable in a wide range of situations.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_jT10dBy1PO" href="#p_jT10dBy1PO"></a>For interfaces that expose a single, focused concept, like a
configuration file reader, this comes naturally. For others, like a
text editor component, which has many different aspects that external
code might need to access (content, styling, user actions, and so on),
it requires careful design.</p>
<h2 id="_functions_as_namespaces">Functions as namespaces</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_Qi0v4Dtc05" href="#p_Qi0v4Dtc05"></a>Functions are the only things in JavaScript that create a new
scope. So if we want our modules to have their own scope, we will have
to base them on functions.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_TJhIvzABX+" href="#p_TJhIvzABX+"></a>Consider this trivial module for associating names with
day-of-the-week numbers, as returned by a <code>Date</code> object&#8217;s <code>getDay</code>
method:</p>

<p><a class=p_ident id="p_lljN2eMCck" href="#p_lljN2eMCck"></a>The <code>dayName</code> function is part of its interface, but the <code>names</code>

  };
}();

<span class="cm-comment">// → Wednesday</span></pre>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_wFyqiGP0o5" href="#p_wFyqiGP0o5"></a>Now <code>names</code> is a local variable in an (unnamed) function. This
function is created and immediately called, and its return value (the
actual <code>dayName</code> function) is stored in a variable. We could have
pages and pages of code in this function, creating a hundred local
variables. They would all be internal to our module, visible to the
module itself, but not to outside code.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_ydjzGXohem" href="#p_ydjzGXohem"></a>A similar pattern is used to isolate code from the outside world
entirely. The module below just has some effect, but does not actually
provide any values for other modules to use.</p>
<pre data-language="javascript" class="snippet cm-s-default"><a class=c_ident id="c_HzELhaatCS" href="#c_HzELhaatCS"></a>(<span class="cm-keyword">function</span>() {

<span class="cm-comment">// → 10000</span></pre>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_NhLZMeErEJ" href="#p_NhLZMeErEJ"></a>This code simply outputs the square of one hundred (in the real world,
it could be a module that adds a method to some prototype, or sets up
some widget on a web page). It wraps its code in a function to prevent
the variables it uses internally from polluting the global scope.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_rouad1+ITt" href="#p_rouad1+ITt"></a>Why is the namespace function wrapped in a pair of parentheses? This
has to do with a quirk in JavaScript&#8217;s syntax. If an <em>expression</em>
starts with the keyword <code>function</code>, it is a function expression.
However, if a <em>statement</em> starts with that keyword, it is a function
declaration, which requires a name and cannot be immediately called.
Even though a statement may start with an expression, the second rule
takes precedence, and if the extra parentheses were left out in the
example above, it would produce a syntax error. You can think of them
as a trick to force the language to see that we are writing an
expression.</p>
<h2 id="_objects_as_interfaces">Objects as interfaces</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_jaxyyZ13ux" href="#p_jaxyyZ13ux"></a>Now imagine that the day-of-the-week module needs to provide not one,
but two functions, because we add a <code>dayNumber</code> function that goes
from a name to a number. We can&#8217;t simply return the function anymore,
but must wrap the two functions in an object.</p>
<pre data-language="javascript" class="snippet cm-s-default"><a class=c_ident id="c_j+iqUdoU2O" href="#c_j+iqUdoU2O"></a><span class="cm-keyword">var</span> <span class="cm-variable">weekDay</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-keyword">function</span>() {

<span class="cm-comment">// → Sunday</span></pre>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_67L/Eo8MtL" href="#p_67L/Eo8MtL"></a>For bigger modules, gathering all the <em>exported</em> values into an object
at the end of the function becomes awkward, and often requires us to
repeat ourselves. This can be improved by declaring an object, usually
named <code>exports</code>, and adding properties to that whenever we are
defining something that needs to be exported. In the example below,
the module function takes its interface object as argument, allowing
code outside of the function to create it and store it in a variable
(<code>this</code>, outside of a function, refers to the global scope object).</p>

<h2 id="_detaching_from_the_global_scope">Detaching from the global scope</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_Q+VZ1qmrF5" href="#p_Q+VZ1qmrF5"></a>The above pattern is commonly used by JavaScript modules intended for
the browser. They will claim a single, known global name, and wrap
their code in a function in order to have their own private namespace.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_ZxPqwSAfjp" href="#p_ZxPqwSAfjp"></a>There is still a problem when multiple modules happen to claim the
same name, or when you want, for whatever reason, to load two versions
of a module alongside each other.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_vMNQP4h9hK" href="#p_vMNQP4h9hK"></a>With a little plumbing, we can create a system that allows modules to
directly ask for the interface objects of other modules they need
access to, without going through the global scope. This solves the
problems mentioned above, and has the added benefit of being explicit
about those dependencies, making it harder to accidentally make use of
some module without stating that you need it.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_0v0mfAlLSj" href="#p_0v0mfAlLSj"></a>Our goal is a function <code>require</code> which, when given a module name, will
load that file (from disk or the Web, depending on the platform
we are running on), and return the appropriate interface value.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_Tpz97q25GG" href="#p_Tpz97q25GG"></a>For this we need at least two things. Firstly, we will imagine that we
have a function <code>readFile</code> (which is not present in standard
JavaScript), which returns the content of the file with the given
name. There are ways to access the Web from JavaScript in the browser,
and to access the hard disk from other JavaScript platforms, but they
are more involved. For now, we just pretend we have this simple
function.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_w3Gcb26Yxk" href="#p_w3Gcb26Yxk"></a>Secondly, we need to be able, when we have a string containing code
(as read from the file), to actually execute this code as a JavaScript
program.</p>
<h2 id="_evaluating_data_as_code">Evaluating data as code</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_jvij1au4eP" href="#p_jvij1au4eP"></a>There are several ways to take data (a string of code) and run it as
part of the current program.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_2aV6cECY5O" href="#p_2aV6cECY5O"></a>The most obvious way is the special standard operator <code>eval</code>, which
will execute a string of code in the <em>current</em> scope. That is usually
a rather bad idea, because it breaks some of the sane properties that
scopes normally have (being isolated from the outside world, most
notably).</p>

<p><a class=p_ident id="p_dJLBESQexx" href="#p_dJLBESQexx"></a>A better way of converting data into program is to use the <code>Function</code>

<p><a class=p_ident id="p_B75dGyOs9V" href="#p_B75dGyOs9V"></a>When using this system, a module typically starts with a few variable
declarations that load the modules it depends on.</p>

<p><a class=p_ident id="p_5GfcRhlMLC" href="#p_5GfcRhlMLC"></a>The simplistic implementation of <code>require</code> given above has several
problems. For one, it will load and run a module every time it is
<code>require</code>d, so if several modules have the same dependency, or a
<code>require</code> call is put inside of a function that will be called
multiple times, time and energy will be wasted.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_40r9rlG4xB" href="#p_40r9rlG4xB"></a>This can be solved by storing the modules that have already been
loaded in an object, and simply returning the existing value if they
are loaded again.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_Ylx5bX6l+o" href="#p_Ylx5bX6l+o"></a>The second problem is that it is not possible for a module to directly
export a single value. For example, a module might want to only export
the constructor of the object type it defines. Right now, it can not
do that, because <code>require</code> always uses the <code>exports</code> object it creates
as the exported value.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_RwxY5rq2Qj" href="#p_RwxY5rq2Qj"></a>The traditional solution for this is to provide another variable,
<code>module</code>, which is an object that has a property <code>exports</code>. This
property initially points at the empty object created by <code>require</code>,
but can be overwritten with another value in order to export something
else.</p>

<p><a class=p_ident id="p_Dv+TulRay7" href="#p_Dv+TulRay7"></a>We now have a module system that uses a single global variable
(<code>require</code>) to allow modules to find and use each other without going
through the global scope.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_CXzJ11+2ak" href="#p_CXzJ11+2ak"></a>This style of module system is called <em>CommonJS modules</em>, after the
pseudo-standard that first specified it. It is built into the node.js
system. Real implementations do a lot more than the example I showed.
Most importantly, they have a much more intelligent way of going from
a module name to an actual piece of code, allowing both pathnames
relative to the current file, and module names that are registered
system-wide.</p>
<h2 id="_slow_loading_modules">Slow-loading modules</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_isvKkfyGNv" href="#p_isvKkfyGNv"></a>Though it is possible to use the style above in JavaScript written for
the browser, it is somewhat involved. The reason for this is that
reading a file (module) from the Web is a lot slower than reading it
from your hard disk. Browser JavaScript is required to behave in such
a way that, while a script is running, nothing else can happen to the
web site in which it runs. This means that if every require call would
go and load something from some far-away web server, the page would
freeze for a painfully long time while loading its scripts.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_ahBYFKVXe7" href="#p_ahBYFKVXe7"></a>There are ways to work around this, for example by running another
program (such as <em><a href="http://browserify.org">Browserify</a></em>) on your program
in advance, which would gather all the dependencies by looking for
calls to <code>require</code>, and put everything together in a big file.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_L9zjrOe2Un" href="#p_L9zjrOe2Un"></a>Another solution is to wrap your module in a function, load the
modules it depends on in the background, and only run this function
when all its dependencies have been loaded. That is what the
<em>Asynchronous Module Definition</em> (<em>AMD</em>) module system does.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_Axqyh548u6" href="#p_Axqyh548u6"></a>Our trivial program with dependencies, in AMD, would looks like this:</p>
<pre data-language="javascript" class="snippet cm-s-default"><a class=c_ident id="c_+VGbHf95V3" href="#c_+VGbHf95V3"></a><span class="cm-variable">define</span>([<span class="cm-string">"weekDay"</span>, <span class="cm-string">"today"</span>], <span class="cm-keyword">function</span>(<span class="cm-def">weekDay</span>, <span class="cm-def">today</span>) {
  <span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-variable-2">weekDay</span>.<span class="cm-property">name</span>(<span class="cm-variable-2">today</span>.<span class="cm-property">dayNumber</span>()));
});</pre>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_/aD387r6Uv" href="#p_/aD387r6Uv"></a>The <code>define</code> function is the central concept of this approach. It
takes first an array of module names, and then a function that takes
one argument for each dependency. It will load the dependencies (if
they haven&#8217;t already been loaded) in the background, allowing the page
to continue working while the files are being fetched. Once all
dependencies are loaded, <code>define</code> will call the function it was given,
with the interfaces of those dependencies as arguments.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_w7/Slpc0XV" href="#p_w7/Slpc0XV"></a>The modules that are loaded this way must themselves contain a call to
<code>define</code>. The value used as their interface is whatever was returned
by the function passed to <code>define</code>. Here is the <code>weekDay</code> module
again:</p>

<p><a class=p_ident id="p_MdRhWVbgQd" href="#p_MdRhWVbgQd"></a>In order to be able show a minimal implementation of <code>define</code>, we will

<p><a class=p_ident id="p_zyHxJxzznn" href="#p_zyHxJxzznn"></a>This is a lot harder to follow than the <code>require</code> function. Its
execution does not follow a simple, predictable path. Instead,
multiple operations are set up to happen at some unspecified time in
the future (when modules finish loading), which obscures the way the
code executes.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_vmCm4oCkaR" href="#p_vmCm4oCkaR"></a>The main problem this code deals with is gathering the interface
values for the module&#8217;s dependencies. To track modules, and their
state, an object is created for each module that is loaded by
<code>define</code>. This object stores the module&#8217;s exported value, a boolean
indicating whether the module has finished loading, and an array
of functions to call when the module does finish loading.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_FwZ+dEQSdz" href="#p_FwZ+dEQSdz"></a>A cache is used to prevent loading modules multiple times, just like we
did for <code>require</code>. When <code>define</code> is called, we first build up an
array of module objects that represent the dependencies of this
module. If the name of a dependency corresponds to a cached module, we
use the existing object. Otherwise, we create a new object (with
<code>loaded</code> set to <code>false</code>) and store that in the cache. We also start
loading the module, using the <code>backgroundReadFile</code> function. Once the
file has loaded, its content is run using the <code>Function</code> constructor.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_BtEdg+BRf4" href="#p_BtEdg+BRf4"></a>It is assumed that the loaded file also contains a (single) call to
<code>define</code>. The <code>define.currentModule</code> property is used to tell this
call about the module object that is currently being loaded, so that
we can update it once it finishes loading.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_jYVfCsUqhK" href="#p_jYVfCsUqhK"></a>This is handled in the <code>whenDepsLoaded</code> function, which is called
once immediately (in case no dependencies need to be loaded) and once
for every dependency that finishes loading. When all dependencies are
there, we call the <code>moduleFunction</code>, passing it the appropriate
exported values. If there is a current module object, the return value
from the function is stored in there, the object is marked as loaded,
and the functions in its <code>onLoad</code> array are called. This will notify
any modules that are waiting for this one that their dependency has
finished loading.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_uewjoUxlIw" href="#p_uewjoUxlIw"></a>A real AMD implementation is, again, quite a lot more clever about
resolving module names to actual URLs, and generally more robust. The
<em>RequireJS</em> (<em>requirejs.org</em>) project provides a popular
implementation of this style of module loader.</p>
<h2 id="_interface_design">Interface design</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_IUZ7uTWwwd" href="#p_IUZ7uTWwwd"></a>Designing interfaces for modules and object
types is one of the subtler aspects of programming. Any non-trivial
piece functionality can be modeled in various ways. Finding a way that
works well requires insight and foresight.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_KweUtWCb7f" href="#p_KweUtWCb7f"></a>The best way to learn the value of good interface design is to use
lots of interfaces, some good, some bad. Experience will teach
you what works and what doesn&#8217;t. Never assume that a painful interface
is “just the way it is”. Fix it, or wrap it in a new interface that
works better for you.</p>
<h3 id="_predictability">Predictability</h3>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_2adqTW0fxP" href="#p_2adqTW0fxP"></a>If programmers can predict the way your interface
works, they (or you) won&#8217;t get sidetracked as often by the need to
look up how to use it. Thus, try to follow conventions. When
there is another module or part of the standard JavaScript environment
that does something similar to what you are implementing, it might be
a good idea to make your interface resemble the existing interface.
That way, it&#8217;ll feel familiar to people who know the existing
interface.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_6l6v5cakoT" href="#p_6l6v5cakoT"></a>Another area where predictability is important is the actual
<em>behavior</em> of your code. It can be tempting to pile on cleverness with
the justification that it makes the interface convenient to use. For
example, you could accept all kinds of different types and
combinations of arguments, and do the “right thing” for all of them,
or provide dozens of specialized convenience functions that provide
slightly different flavors of your module&#8217;s functionality. These might
make code that builds on your interface slightly shorter, but they
will also make it much harder for people to build a clear mental model
of the module&#8217;s behavior.</p>
<h3 id="_composability">Composability</h3>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_9Nt/796F0G" href="#p_9Nt/796F0G"></a>In your interfaces, try to use the simplest data
structures that work and make functions do a single, clear
thing—whenever practical, make them pure functions (see Chapter 3).</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_qicKwwcIoO" href="#p_qicKwwcIoO"></a>For example, it is not uncommon for modules to provide their own
array-like collection objects, with their own interface for counting
and extracting elements. Such objects won&#8217;t have <code>map</code> or <code>forEach</code>
methods, and any existing function that expects a real array won&#8217;t be
able to work with them. This is an example of poor
<em>composability</em>—the module cannot be easily composed with other
code.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_Ay3y/rzQr9" href="#p_Ay3y/rzQr9"></a>Another example would be a module for
spell-checking text, which we might need when we want to write a text
editor. The spell-checker could be made to operate directly on
whichever complicated data structures the editor uses, and directly
call internal functions in the editor to have the user choose between
spelling suggestions. If we go that way, the module cannot be used
with any other programs. On the other hand, if we define the
spell-checking interface so that you can pass it a simple string and
it will return the position in the string where it found a possible
misspelling, along with an array of suggested corrections, then we
have an interface that could also be composed with other systems,
because strings and arrays are always available.</p>
<h3 id="_layered_interfaces">Layered interfaces</h3>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_V27FdPKVq9" href="#p_V27FdPKVq9"></a>When designing an interface for a
complex piece of functionality—for example sending email—you often run
into a dilemma. On the one hand, you do not want to overload the user
of your interface with details. They shouldn&#8217;t have to study your
interface for 20 minutes before they can send an email. On the other
hand, you do not want to hide the details either—when people need
to do complicated things with your module, that should also be
possible.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_UAqdlcM0M6" href="#p_UAqdlcM0M6"></a>Often the solution is to provide two interfaces: a detailed
<em>low-level</em> one for complex situations and a simple <em>high-level</em> one
for routine use. The second can usually be built very easily using the
tools provided by the first. In the email module, the high-level
interface could just be a function that takes a message, a sender
address, and a receiver address, and sends the email. The low-level
interface would allow full control over email headers, attachments,
sending HTML mail, and so on.</p>
<h2 id="_summary">Summary</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_hGwRhRocwV" href="#p_hGwRhRocwV"></a>Modules provide structure to bigger programs by separating the code
into different files and namespaces. Giving these modules well-defined
interfaces makes them easier to use, easier to reuse in different
contexts, and makes it possible to continue using them as the module
itself evolves.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_G2usOklg33" href="#p_G2usOklg33"></a>Though the JavaScript language itself is characteristically unhelpful
when it comes to modules, the flexible functions and objects it
provides make it possible to define rather nice module systems.
Function scopes can be used as internal namespaces for the module, and
objects can be used to store sets of exported values.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_0LAk7BPgRr" href="#p_0LAk7BPgRr"></a>There are two popular, well-defined approaches to such modules. One is
called <em>CommonJS Modules</em>, and revolves around a <code>require</code> function
that fetches a module by name and returns its interface. The other is
called <em>AMD</em>, and uses a <code>define</code> function that takes an array of
module names and a function, and, after loading the modules, runs the
function with their interfaces as arguments.</p>
<h2 id="_exercises">Exercises</h2>
<h3 id="_month_names">Month names</h3>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_dU0pnoSPR9" href="#p_dU0pnoSPR9"></a>Write a simple module similar to the <code>weekDay</code> module, which can
convert month numbers (zero-based, as in the <code>Date</code> type) to names,
and names back to numbers. Give it its own namespace, since it will
need an internal array of month names, but use plain JavaScript,
without any module loader system.</p>

<p><a class=p_ident id="p_N564mECTK6" href="#p_N564mECTK6"></a>This follows the <code>weekDay</code> module almost exactly. A function
expression, called immediately, wraps the variable that holds the
array of names, along with the two functions that must be exported.
The functions are put in an object, and returned. The returned
interface object is stored in the <code>month</code> variable.</p>

<p><a class=p_ident id="p_+royQ52RxC" href="#p_+royQ52RxC"></a>Hoping that Chapter 7 is still somewhat fresh in your mind, think back
to the system designed in that chapter and come up with a separation
into modules of the code. To refresh your memory, these are the
functions and types defined in that chapter, in order of appearance.</p>

<p><a class=p_ident id="p_eCCQP4qyV9" href="#p_eCCQP4qyV9"></a>Do not exaggerate and create too many modules. A book that starts a
new chapter for every page would probably get on your nerves, if only
because of all the space wasted on titles. Similarly, having to open
ten files to read a tiny project isn&#8217;t helpful. Aim for three to five
modules.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_fDzWqQqyw8" href="#p_fDzWqQqyw8"></a>You can choose to have some functions become internal to their module,
and thus inaccessible to other modules.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_XYYo0/YDOl" href="#p_XYYo0/YDOl"></a>There is no single correct solution here. Module organization is
largely a matter of taste.</p>
<div class=solution><div class=solution-text>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_E3iJwXoILn" href="#p_E3iJwXoILn"></a>Here is what I came up with. I&#8217;ve put parentheses around internal
functions.</p>
<pre>Module "grid"
  Vector
  Grid
  directions

Module "world"
  (randomElement)
  (elementFromChar)
  (charFromElement)
  View
  World
  LifelikeWorld
  directions [re-exported]

Module "simple_ecosystem"
  (randomElement) [duplicated]
  (directionNames)
  (dirPlus)
  Wall
  BouncingCritter
  WallFollower

Module "ecosystem"
  Wall [duplicated]
  Plant
  PlantEater
  SmartPlantEater
  Tiger</pre>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_WwbuvXrzDT" href="#p_WwbuvXrzDT"></a>I have re-exported the <code>directions</code> array from the <code>grid</code> module from
<code>world</code>, so that modules built on that (the ecosystems) don&#8217;t have to
know or worry about the existence of the <code>grid</code> module.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_2pzeyE24tw" href="#p_2pzeyE24tw"></a>I also duplicated two generic and tiny helper values (<code>randomElement</code>
and <code>Wall</code>) since they are used as internal details in different
contexts, and do not belong in the interfaces for these modules.</p>
</div></div>
<h3 id="_circular_dependencies">Circular dependencies</h3>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_/LVNV6+2SH" href="#p_/LVNV6+2SH"></a>A tricky subject in dependency management is circular dependencies,
where module A depends on B, and B also depends on A. Many module
systems simply forbid this. CommonJS allows a limited form of this,
where it works as long as the modules do not replace their default
<code>exports</code> object with another value, and only start accessing each
other&#8217;s interface after they finish loading.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_BFm3QczrDZ" href="#p_BFm3QczrDZ"></a>Can you think of a way in which support for this feature could be
implemented? Look back to the definition of <code>require</code>, and consider
what the function would have to do to allow this.</p>
<div class=solution><div class=solution-text>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_By5oQNAE2m" href="#p_By5oQNAE2m"></a>The trick is to add the <code>exports</code> object created for a module to
<code>require</code>'s cache <em>before</em> actually running the module. This means the
module will not yet have had a chance to override <code>module.exports</code>, so
we do not know whether it may want to export some other value. After
loading, the cache object is overridden with <code>module.exports</code>, which
may be a different value.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_xRLcTfyWjS" href="#p_xRLcTfyWjS"></a>But if, in the course of loading the module, a second module is loaded
that asks for the first module, its default <code>exports</code> object, likely
still empty at this point, will be in the cache, and the second module
will receive a reference to it. If it doesn&#8217;t try to do anything with
the object until the first module has finished loading, things will
work.</p>
