<h1><div class=chap_num>Chapter 12</div>JavaScript and the Browser</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_oSbDqg89i/" href="#p_oSbDqg89i/"></a>The browser is a really hostile programming environment.</p>
 <footer>Douglas Crockford, <cite>The JavaScript Programming Language (video lecture)</cite></footer>
</blockquote>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_y+yPZKXQKE" href="#p_y+yPZKXQKE"></a>Traditionally, JavaScript&#8217;s strongest point has been that it is one of
the few languages that can be embedded in a web page, and of those
languages, it provides the most convenient, well-integrated style of
embedding.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_GZ7nJVK3wA" href="#p_GZ7nJVK3wA"></a>The next part of this book will talk about web browsers. Without web
browsers, there would be no JavaScript. (And even if there would be, no
one would ever have paid any attention to it.)</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_XT5pNqisw+" href="#p_XT5pNqisw+"></a>Web technology has, from the very start, been decentralized, not just
technically, but also in the way in which it evolved. Various parties
have added new functionality in ad-hoc (and often poorly thought out)
ways, which then sometimes ended up being adopted by others, and
finally set down as a standard.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_ePAQfpo7ra" href="#p_ePAQfpo7ra"></a>This is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, it is empowering
to not have a central party control a system, but have it be improved
by various parties working in loose collaboration (or, occasionally,
open hostility). On the other hand, the haphazard way in which it was
developed means that the resulting system is not exactly a shining
example of internal consistency. In fact, some parts of it are
downright messy and confusing.</p>
<h2 id="_networks_and_the_internet">Networks and the Internet</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_hsMIYbAKNv" href="#p_hsMIYbAKNv"></a>Computer networks have been known since the 1950s. If you put cables
between two or more computers, and allow them to send data back and
forth through these cables, you can do all kinds of wonderful
things.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_rRsGS85yhE" href="#p_rRsGS85yhE"></a>If connecting two machines in the same building allows us to do
wonderful things, connecting machines all over the planet should be
even better. The technology to start implementing this vision was
developed in the 1980s, and the resulting network is called the
<em>Internet</em>. It has lived up to its promise.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_cvrUZPtUxT" href="#p_cvrUZPtUxT"></a>A computer can use this network to spew bits at another computer. For
any effective communication to arise out of this bit-spewing, the
computers at both ends must know what the bits are supposed to
represent. The meaning of any given sequence of bits depends entirely
on the kind of thing that it is trying to express, and the encoding
mechanism used.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_tlYBPgx73H" href="#p_tlYBPgx73H"></a>A <em>network protocol</em> is a description of a style of communication over
a network. There are protocols for sending email, fetching email,
sharing files, or even for controlling computers that happen to be
infected by malicious software.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_u8lDPIC39z" href="#p_u8lDPIC39z"></a>For example, a simple chat protocol might consist of one computer
sending the bits that represent the text “CHAT?” to another
machine, and the other responding with “OK!” to confirm that it
understands the protocol. They can then proceed to send each other
strings of text, read the text sent by the other from the network,
and display whatever they receive on their screens.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_WXSVtMixCt" href="#p_WXSVtMixCt"></a>Most protocols are built on top of other protocols. Our example
protocol treats the network as a stream-like device, into which you
can put bits, and have them arrive at the correct destination, in the
correct order. Ensuring those things is already a rather difficult
technical problem.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_20U5dj/Jo+" href="#p_20U5dj/Jo+"></a>TCP (<em>Transmission Control Protocol</em>) is a protocol that solves this
problem. All internet-connected devices “speak” it, and most
communication on the Internet is built on top of it.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_R1N5wYYFn+" href="#p_R1N5wYYFn+"></a>A TCP connection works as follows: one computer must be waiting,
“listening”, for other computers to start talking to it. To be able to
listen for different kinds of communication at the same time on a
single machine, each listener has a number (called <em>port</em>) associated
with it. Most protocols specify which port should be used by default.
For example, when we want to send an email using the SMTP protocol,
the machine through which we send it is expected to be listening on
port 25.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_c1+G2O/5Li" href="#p_c1+G2O/5Li"></a>Another computer can then establish a connection by connecting to our
machine using the correct port number. If the target machine can be
reached, and is listening on that port, the connection is successfully
created. The listening computer is called the <em>server</em>, and the
connecting computer the <em>client</em>.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_g48pTp1IKV" href="#p_g48pTp1IKV"></a>Such a connection acts as a two-way pipe through which bits can
flow—the machines on both ends can put data into it, which can, once
successfully transmitted, be read out again by the machine on the
other side. This is a very convenient model. You could say that TCP
provides an abstraction of the network.</p>
<h2 id="_the_web">The Web</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_w4VQt163Im" href="#p_w4VQt163Im"></a>The <em>World Wide Web</em> (not to be confused with the Internet as a whole)
is a set of protocols and formats that allow us to open web pages in a
browser. The “Web” part in the name refers to the fact that such pages
can easily link to each other, thus connecting into a huge mesh that
users can move through.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_IX9vl21tDt" href="#p_IX9vl21tDt"></a>To add content to this Web, all that is needed is to connect a machine
to the Internet, and have it listen on port 80, using HTTP (the
<em>Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol</em>). This protocol allows other computers
to request documents over the network.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_jTUET1uLK8" href="#p_jTUET1uLK8"></a>Each document is named by a URL (<em>Universal Resource Locator</em>), which
looks something like this:</p>
<pre>  http://eloquentjavascript.net/12_browser.html
 |      |                      |               |
 protocol       server               path</pre>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_0F4MKpLU9B" href="#p_0F4MKpLU9B"></a>The first part tells us that this URL uses the HTTP protocol (as
opposed to for example, secure, encrypted HTTP, which would be
<code>https://</code>). Then comes the part that identifies the machine which we
should ask for the document. And finally, after that, a string that
identifies the actual document (or <em>resource</em>) we are interested in.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_/GdEX6bncv" href="#p_/GdEX6bncv"></a>Each machine connected to the Internet gets a unique address (its <em>IP
address</em>), which will look something like <code>37.187.37.82</code>. You can use
those directly as the server part of a URL. But lists of more or less
random numbers are hard to remember and awkward to type, so it is
possible to globally register <em>hostnames</em> as pointing towards a
specific machine (or set of machines). I registered
<code>eloquentjavascript.net</code> to point at the IP address of a machine I
control, and can thus use it to serve web pages.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_fOmD/mI+Pc" href="#p_fOmD/mI+Pc"></a>If you type the URL above into your browser&#8217;s address bar, it will try
to retrieve and display it. First, it has to find out what address
<code>eloquentjavascript.net</code> refers to, and then, using the HTTP protocol,
make a connection to the server at that address, and ask it for the
file <em>/12_browser.html</em>.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_pfUoCDr2pV" href="#p_pfUoCDr2pV"></a>We will take a closer look at the HTTP protocol in Chapter 17.</p>
<h2 id="_html">HTML</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_m2H1Cp4ACJ" href="#p_m2H1Cp4ACJ"></a>HTML, which stands for <em>Hyper-Text Markup Language</em>, is the document
format used for web pages. An HTML document contains text, as well as
extra information that gives structure to the text, describing things
like links, paragraphs, and headings.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_P2V14LZFIv" href="#p_P2V14LZFIv"></a>A simple HTML document looks like this:</p>
<pre data-language="text/html" class="snippet cm-s-default"><a class=c_ident id="c_IYtstBHgkS" href="#c_IYtstBHgkS"></a><span class="cm-meta">&lt;!doctype html></span>

<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;/</span><span class="cm-tag">html</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span></pre>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_9KPS5DK7LV" href="#p_9KPS5DK7LV"></a>The parts wrapped in angular brackets (“<code>&lt;</code>” and “<code>&gt;</code>”) provide
information about the structure of the document. The text outside of
that is just plain text.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_7PI7BADgG4" href="#p_7PI7BADgG4"></a>The document starts with <code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</code>, which tells the browser to
interpret it as <em>modern</em> HTML, as opposed to the various dialects that
were in use in the past.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_Et3bT2kUby" href="#p_Et3bT2kUby"></a>HTML documents have a head and a body. The head contains information
<em>about</em> the document, and the body contains the document itself. So in
this case, we first declare that the title of this document is “My
home page”, and then give a document containing a heading (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>,
“heading 1”, as opposed to more minor headings, denoted <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> to
<code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>) and two paragraphs (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>).</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_VRP3571rEI" href="#p_VRP3571rEI"></a><em>Tags</em>, which is what the angular-bracket-enclosed parts of an HTML
document are called, come in several forms. An element, such as the
body, a paragraph, or a link, is started by an <em>opening tag</em> like
<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, and ended by a <em>closing tag</em>, which looks like <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>. Some
opening tags, such as the one for the link (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) contain extra
information, in the form of <code>name="value"</code> pairs. These are called
<em>attributes</em>. In this case, the destination of the link is indicated
with <code>href="http://eloquentjavascript.net"</code>, where <code>href</code> stands for
“hypertext reference”.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_Zq+hhLzTkO" href="#p_Zq+hhLzTkO"></a>Finally, some kinds of tags do not enclose anything, and thus do not
need to be closed. An example of this would be <code>&lt;img
src="http://example.com/image.jpg"&gt;</code>, which will display the image
found at the given source URL.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_AxbPs9bktc" href="#p_AxbPs9bktc"></a>Whenever some characters get a special meaning, a notation is needed
to “escape” them, to include them in the actual text without
triggering their special meaning, similar to the way backslashes are
used in JavaScript strings. HTML&#8217;s approach to this is a bit more
heavyweight, it uses an ampersand (“&amp;”) character, followed by a word
and a semicolon (“;”). The sequence <code>&amp;lt;</code> stands for “&lt;” (“less
than”), and <code>&amp;gt;</code> stands for “&gt;” (“greater than”). Since this
notation also gives “&amp;” itself a special meaning, it can be escaped
with <code>&amp;amp;</code>. Finally, to write a double quote inside an attribute
value, <code>&amp;quot;</code> can be used.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_RK6LQEinS9" href="#p_RK6LQEinS9"></a>HTML is parsed in a remarkably error-tolerant way. When tags that
should be there are missing, the browser reconstruct them. The way in
which this is done has been standardized, and you can rely on modern
browsers all doing it in the same way.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_zaRquwn0z2" href="#p_zaRquwn0z2"></a>The following document will be treated just like the one above:</p>
<pre data-language="text/html" class="snippet cm-s-default"><a class=c_ident id="c_tft01og/d/" href="#c_tft01og/d/"></a><span class="cm-meta">&lt;!doctype html></span>

<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;</span><span class="cm-tag">title</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>My home page<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;/</span><span class="cm-tag">title</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>

<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;</span><span class="cm-tag">h1</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>My home page<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;/</span><span class="cm-tag">h1</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>
<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;</span><span class="cm-tag">p</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>Hello, I am Marijn and this is my home page.
<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;</span><span class="cm-tag">p</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>I also wrote a book! Read it
  <span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;</span><span class="cm-tag">a</span> <span class="cm-attribute">href</span>=<span class="cm-string">http://eloquentjavascript.net</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>here<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;/</span><span class="cm-tag">a</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>.</pre>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_6iDhitY04v" href="#p_6iDhitY04v"></a>The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags are gone completely. The
browser knows that <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> belongs in a head, and <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> in a body.
Furthermore, I am no longer explicitly closing the paragraphs, since
the opening of another paragraph, or the end of the document, will
close them implicitly. The quotes around the link target are also
gone.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_qf+9uiBgHE" href="#p_qf+9uiBgHE"></a>This book will usually omit the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags
from examples, to keep them short and free of noise. Tags will be
closed normally, though, and quotes included.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_W5yIrvHZFo" href="#p_W5yIrvHZFo"></a>We will also usually omit the doctype. This is not to be taken as an
encouragement to omit doctype declarations. Browsers will often do
ridiculous things when you forget them. A doctype should be considered
to be implicitly present in the examples, even when not actually
shown in the text.</p>
<h2 id="_html_and_javascript">HTML and JavaScript</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_Eruo+DmcTl" href="#p_Eruo+DmcTl"></a>In the context of this book, the most important HTML tag is
<code>&lt;script&gt;</code>. This tag allows us to include a piece of JavaScript in a
document.</p>
<pre data-language="text/html" class="snippet cm-s-default"><a class=c_ident id="c_zqxggADYLJ" href="#c_zqxggADYLJ"></a><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;</span><span class="cm-tag">h1</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>Testing alert<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;/</span><span class="cm-tag">h1</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>
<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;</span><span class="cm-tag">script</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span><span class="cm-variable">alert</span>(<span class="cm-string">"hello!"</span>);<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;/</span><span class="cm-tag">script</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span></pre>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_3pFG6nbfUJ" href="#p_3pFG6nbfUJ"></a>Such a script will run as soon as its <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag is encountered,
during the reading of the HTML. The page above will pop up an <code>alert</code>
dialog when opened.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_6KcM5rttoD" href="#p_6KcM5rttoD"></a>Putting bigger programs into the HTML document in their entirety is
often impractical. The <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag can also be given an <code>src</code>
attribute in order to cause the script file (a text file containing
the JavaScript program) to be fetched from a URL.</p>
<pre data-language="text/html" class="snippet cm-s-default"><a class=c_ident id="c_/fMKrNIkmD" href="#c_/fMKrNIkmD"></a><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;</span><span class="cm-tag">h1</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>Testing alert<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;/</span><span class="cm-tag">h1</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>
<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;</span><span class="cm-tag">script</span> <span class="cm-attribute">src</span>=<span class="cm-string">"js/hello.js"</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">>&lt;/</span><span class="cm-tag">script</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span></pre>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_qRKXMZOL1g" href="#p_qRKXMZOL1g"></a>The <em>js/hello.js</em> file included here contains the same simple program,
<code>alert("hello!")</code>. When an HTML page references other URLs as part of
itself, for example an image file or a script, web browsers will
retrieve those immediately, and include them in the page.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_DLaR5M/yDv" href="#p_DLaR5M/yDv"></a>A script tag must always be closed with <code>&lt;/script&gt;</code>, even if it refers
to a script file and doesn&#8217;t contain any code. If you forget this, the
rest of the page will be interpreted as part of the script.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_spiklXn9Z0" href="#p_spiklXn9Z0"></a>Some attributes can also contain a JavaScript program. The <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>
tag (which shows up as a button) below is given an <code>onclick</code>
attribute, whose content will be run whenever the button is pressed.</p>
<pre data-language="text/html" class="snippet cm-s-default"><a class=c_ident id="c_xVK2SBbuh0" href="#c_xVK2SBbuh0"></a><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;</span><span class="cm-tag">button</span> <span class="cm-attribute">onclick</span>=<span class="cm-string">"alert('Boom!')"</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span>DO NOT PRESS<span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">&lt;/</span><span class="cm-tag">button</span><span class="cm-tag cm-bracket">></span></pre>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_hBrXiBnQxx" href="#p_hBrXiBnQxx"></a>Note that I had to use single quotes for the string in the <code>onclick</code>
attribute, because double quotes are already used to quote the whole
attribute. We could also have used <code>&amp;quot;</code>, but that&#8217;d make the
program harder to read.</p>
<h2 id="_in_the_sandbox">In the sandbox</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_AniKiqdG2y" href="#p_AniKiqdG2y"></a>Running programs downloaded off the Internet is potentially dangerous.
You do not know much about the people behind most sites you visit, and
they do not necessarily mean well. Running programs by people who do
not mean well is how you get your computer infected by viruses, your
data stolen, and your accounts hacked.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_D7H4XfnmGB" href="#p_D7H4XfnmGB"></a>Yet the attraction of the Web is that you can “surf” it without
trusting all the pages you visit. This is why browsers severely limit
the things a JavaScript program may do. It is not allowed to look at
the files on your computer or to modify anything not related to the
web page it was embedded in.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_KW2fU3B9nm" href="#p_KW2fU3B9nm"></a>Isolating a programming environment like this is called <em>sandboxing</em>,
implying that the program will be harmlessly playing in a sandbox.
This particular kind of sandbox should be imagined with a cage of
thick steel bars over it though, which makes it somewhat different
from your typical playground sandbox.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_7pNt468QvZ" href="#p_7pNt468QvZ"></a>The hard part of sandboxing is allowing the programs enough room to be
useful, yet at the same time restricting them from doing anything
dangerous. Many things that are needed to create certain kinds of
applications, such as communicating to other servers, or reading the
content of the copy-paste clipboard, can also be used to do
problematic, privacy-invading things.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_0xA5OSkc0i" href="#p_0xA5OSkc0i"></a>Every now and then, someone comes up with a new way to circumvent the
limitations of a browser and do something harmful, ranging from
leaking minor private information to taking over the whole machine
that the browser runs on. The people responsible for the browsers
respond by modifying their programs to make this trick impossible, and
all is well again—until the next problem is discovered (and,
hopefully, publicized instead of being secretly used by some
government or mafia).</p>
<h2 id="_compatibility_and_the_browser_wars">Compatibility and the browser wars</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_FiVijQGMGC" href="#p_FiVijQGMGC"></a>In the very early stages of the Web, a browser called Mosaic dominated
the market. After a few years, the balance had shifted to Netscape,
which was then, in turn, largely superseded by Microsoft&#8217;s Internet
Explorer. At any point where a single browser was dominant, that
browser&#8217;s vendor would feel entitled to unilaterally invent new
features for the Web. Since most users used the same browser, web
sites would simply start using those features, never mind the other
browsers.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_VsfVT8QgQV" href="#p_VsfVT8QgQV"></a>This was the dark age of compatibility, often called the “browser
wars”. Web developers were left with not one Web, but two or three
incompatible platforms. To make things worse, the browsers in use
around 2003 were all full of bugs, and of course, the bugs were
different for each browser. Life was hard for people writing web
pages.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_K5Wu7RrwZS" href="#p_K5Wu7RrwZS"></a>Mozilla Firefox, a not-for-profit offshoot of Netscape, challenged
Internet Explorer&#8217;s hegemony in the late 2000s, and because Microsoft
was, at the time, not particularly interested in staying competitive,
took quite a chunk of market share away from it. Around the same time,
Google introduced its Chrome browser, and Apple&#8217;s Safari browser
gained popularity, leading to a situation where there were four major
players, rather than one.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_ztjPRIOS1D" href="#p_ztjPRIOS1D"></a>The new players showed both a more serious attitude towards standards,
and more solid engineering practices. Microsoft, seeing its market
share crumble, came around and adopted these attitudes. If you are
starting to learn web development today, consider yourself lucky. The
latest versions of the major browsers behave quite uniformly, and have
relatively few bugs.</p>

the people using the Web are, for reasons of inertia or corporate
policy, stuck with very old browsers. Until those die out entirely,
writing web sites that work for them will require a lot of arcane
knowledge about their shortcomings and quirks.</p>
